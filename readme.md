#### Do not contact mod authors directly for support.

Pirated games and mods are not supported

## Requirements before installing

- Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found from [the Wabbajack website](https://www.wabbajack.org)
- Clean install of Fallout 4, with all DLCs **except** HD DLC. Non-negotiable.
- A Nexusmods account. Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.
- 142 Gb of space. 60 Gb for the downloads folder, and 82 Gb for the actual install.
- A graphics card with at LEAST 6Gb VRAM is recommended, but a card with 3-4Gb can still use this list, with lower graphical settings.

## Game Preparations

Once Fallout 4 is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the Fallout 4 splash screen, and exit).

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Launch Wabbajack.exe
5. Click 'Browse Modlists'
6. Check the 'Show NSFW' check box in the top right of the window
7. Locate Devil's Food Cake and click the 'Download Modlist' button
8. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Wasteland Survival). This location CANNOT be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.
10. The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.
11. Click the "Play" arrow.
12. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
13. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

## Post Installation Instructions

1. Navigate back to your FO4NSFW installation folder.
2. Open “Game Folder Files”
3. Copy everything in this folder.
4. Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).

#### Optional Mods

- If you have an Ultrawide monitor, enable the TruBy9 UltraWide Fallout 4 and DEF_INV compatibility fix patches to fix issues with UI scaling
- If you are running Fallout 4 over 60 FPS and have issues with the game physics, make sure to lock your FPS.

**That’s almost it!** Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the FO4NSFW folder.
From now on, launch Fallout 4 via the “F4SE” option. <br>
If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda, open Steam, right-click Fallout 4 in your Library, open Properties,  <br>
go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to “Only update this game when I launch it.”  <br>
Make sure Steam is launched and logged in before launching Fo4 with F4SE or else Steam will launch the native way and force an update should there be one available.  <br>
Since we’re always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again should you do as I have just instructed. <br>

## In-Game Configuration - Ingame

Once you finish MCM setup, you’ll have three options when you try to leave.

- This is a dream: You will wake up in Vault 111. Nora is not your wife. Codsworth is not your robot. You’re just a random Pre-war Sanctuary citizen.
- This is a memory, I don’t want to relive this: You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate or Nora. Everything else is normal.
- This is a memory, stay here a while: Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.

I HIGHLY recommend you read the MCG Guide found <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/119951-aaf-mcg-extended-social-interactions/?tab=comments#comment-2579591">Here</a> so you can understand how the mod works. 

Otherwise, it will be very confusing.

To start MCG, press and hold the Options for MCG Hotkey for a couple seconds, then release.  <br>
Scroll down, and select ‘Start Npc Initiative System.’  <br>
The menu will then close.  <br>
Wait until the messages stop appearing in the top left of your screen, then do the same for ‘Start Npc random sex system’ and ‘Start Player Defeat System’
