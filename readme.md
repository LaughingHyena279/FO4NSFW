## Requirements before installing

- Current build version of Wabbajack. This can be found on the Wabbajack Discord linked above.
- Clean install of Fallout 4, with all DLCs **except** HD DLC. Non-negotiable.
- A Nexusmods account. Premium is highly recommended for automatic download support.
- 73 Gb of space. 32 Gb for the downloads folder, and 41 Gb for the actual install.
- A graphics card with at LEAST 6Gb VRAM is recommended, but a card with 3-4Gb can still use this list, with lower graphical settings.

## Game Preparations

Once Fallout 4 is installed, make sure you run it once. (Get to the Fallout 4 splash screen, and exit).

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the latest version of Wabbajack.
2. Create a new folder at the root of a drive (Example: D:\Wabbajack).
3. Place the Wabbajack.exe into this new folder.
4. Download the newest FO4 NSFW List file from the NSFW Mod DIscussion chanel.
Place the modlist file into a new folder (example: D:\Wabbajack\downloaded_mod_lists)
5. Launch Wabbajack.exe
6. Select "Install a Modlist"
7. Choose the FO4NSFW.wabbajack file you just downloaded.
8. In “Installation Location” choose a blank folder at the root of a drive (example: D:\Wasteland Survival). This location CANNOT be where you have the Wabbajack.exe located.
10. The "Download Location" will update automatically. You can change it if you wish.
11. Click the "Play" arrow.
12. Make sure to accept the Nexus API request if your browser asks for it.
13. When Wabbajack completes the installation (you can check the Wabbajack.exe.log to confirm it completed successfully), you may close the program.

## Post Installation Instructions

1. Navigate back to your FO4NSFW installation folder.
2. Open “Game Folder Files”
3. Copy everything in this folder.
4. Paste it into your Fallout 4 directory (steam/steamapps/common/Fallout 4).

#### Optional Mods

- If you have an Ultrawide monitor, enable the TruBy9 UltraWide Fallout 4 and DEF_INV compatibility fix patches to fix issues with UI scaling
- If you are running Fallout 4 over 60 FPS and have issues with the game physics, make sure to lock your FPS.

*That’s almost it!* Launch Mod Organizer 2 inside the FO4NSFW folder. 
From now on, launch Fallout 4 via the “F4SE” option.
If you want to avoid the hassle of future updates from Bethesda, open Steam, right-click Fallout 4 in your Library, open Properties, 
go to the Updates tab, and change the Automatic Update option to “Only update this game when I launch it.” 
Make sure Steam is launched and logged in before launching Fo4 with F4SE or else Steam will launch the native way and force an update should there be one available. 
Since we’re always launching from F4SE, it will never automatically update again should you do as I have just instructed.


## In-Game Configuration

The MCG Menu will come up before creating your character. Click the option to start the mod now. 
After creating your character, wait for all messages to stop appearing in the top left corner, and open the Mod Configuration Menu and apply these settings:

AAF Sex ‘Em Up
- Hotkeys
  - Set Sex ‘Em Up Active Hotkey
  - Set Sex ‘Em Up Passive Hotkey
  
FO4HHS

  - Enable Dynamic Camera - On

  - Suck for smokes dialogue - On

Now, we still have a little bit of work left to do, but we’re almost done. 
Now we can launch the game. 
Once you finish MCM setup, you’ll have three options when you try to leave.

- This is a dream: You will wake up in Vault 111. Nora is not your wife. Codsworth is not your robot. You’re just a random Pre-war Sanctuary citizen.
- This is a memory, I don’t want to relive this: You wake up in Vault 111 as Nate or Nora. Everything else is normal.
- This is a memory, stay here a while: Vanilla Fallout 4 intro.

I HIGHLY recommend you read the MCG Guide found <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/119951-aaf-mcg-extended-social-interactions/?tab=comments#comment-2579591">Here</a> so you can understand how the mod works. 
Otherwise, it will be very confusing.

To start MCG, press and hold the Main MCG Hotkey for a couple seconds, then release. 
Scroll down, and select ‘Start Npc Initiative System.’ 
The menu will then close. 
Wait until the messages stop appearing in the top left of your screen, then do the same for ‘Start Npc random sex system’ and ‘Start Player Defeat System’

Also, if you want to play in a raider/ghoul/synth wasteland with no main quest, FO4-76 is included. Open the holotape after leaving the vault to initiate it.
